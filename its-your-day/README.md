# It's Your Day

We do a thing at our house where we have a rotation for what we call "It's Your Day" to help decide who gets to do "fun" things (like bring in packages from the porch 📦).

The complication is that we only do it on part of the week, so we wanted some way to track the drift over time.

I wrote this bot as a way to post an announcement in Zulip at the beginning of every day whose "day" it is, if it is someone's day, so that any time we have anything like a package delivery notification, we can check that channel to see who should be alerted to go grab it.
